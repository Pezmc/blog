We are almost ready to begin ticket sales for EMF 2022!

If you had a ticket for EMF 2020 you will receive a voucher by email allowing you to purchase a ticket for EMF 2022. We'll be sending these in the coming weeks, and they will be valid for one month - once your voucher has expired you will have to buy tickets in the public sale.

If you bought a ticket for EMF 2020 and haven't received a voucher by January 15, please [drop us an email](mailto:contact@emfcamp.org).

After the vouchers have expired, we will place any remaining tickets on public sale - keep an eye on our [mailing list and Twitter](https://www.emfcamp.org/about/contact#Get%20Updates) for sale dates.

## Prices

Unfortunately we have had to significantly raise ticket prices, with adult tickets now starting at Â£165.

The costs of running EMF have increased due to a number of causes, many of which have their roots in Brexit and COVID-19. In particular, increased transport costs due to the ongoing shortage of HGV drivers and the removal of reduced rate fuel duty on diesel have had significant effects on our operating costs.

We are also applying for insurance under the UK government's new COVID [Live Events Reinsurance Scheme](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/live-events-reinsurance-scheme). This is expensive but it will allow us to reclaim costs and refund all ticketholders if local or national COVID restrictions force us to cancel EMF 2022.

## Refunds

We've made some changes to our refund policy this year to try and give you more flexibility while still allowing us enough certainty to run the event.

Tickets will be refundable with no questions asked until the 1st March 2022. After that, refund requests will be placed in a queue and processed in order, as soon as we have sold enough tickets to break even on the event.

We will also be offering full refunds if you are unable to attend EMF because you have COVID-19. We'll provide more details on this closer to the event.

## COVID-19

We're continuing to follow the COVID-19 situation closely, and much has changed since we made [the decision to cancel EMF 2020](https://blog.emfcamp.org/2020/03/25/emf-2020-cancelled/).

Much more is likely to change (hopefully for the better) in the next six months, but whatever happens we will be taking steps to ensure the safety of EMF attendees and volunteers.

Given the constantly changing situation we cannot yet specify what measures will be implemented on site - the COVID precautions we take at EMF will be governed by the prevalence closer to the time, as well as any government restrictions in force.

## Call for Participation

We'll be opening the call for talks, workshops, films, installations, and terrifying robots in the near future. If you have an idea you want to discuss before submission, please contact our content team on [content@emfcamp.org](mailto:content@emfcamp.org)

## Sponsorship

Sponsorship is now open, and we're seeking wonderful sponsors to help us make EMF 2022 even more incredible!

Details of sponsorship packages are available on our [sponsor pages](https://emfcamp.org/sponsor).

## 2022!

It has been a very long time since EMF 2018. We can't wait to see what you've all been up to for the last four years - let's make this an EMF to remember.

See you in the field!

Love,
The EMF Team
