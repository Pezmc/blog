After just a few years of rapid growth there now are dozens of hackerspaces and makerspaces in the UK, with thousands of members. In addition there are countless other communities of craftsmen, artists, designers, engineers who are interested in the same DIY ethic, who are inquisitive, and keen to make things.


This large community still has few opportunities to meet up across disciplines and talk shop, socialise, meet new people, teach others and learn from others. Most events are small regional conferences and often focused on very specific themes.


This year we want to bring everyone together for a large UK-wide camping festival, held in a field near Milton Keynes from 31 August to 2 September. The event is organised by a non-profit organisation and produced entirely by volunteers. We are members of well-known hackerspaces and other organisations.


We hope that you will join us, and invite you to help us turn it into something special! More details will follow very soon.
