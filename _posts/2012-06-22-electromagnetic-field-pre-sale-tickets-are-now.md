As promised pre-sale tickets for Electromagnetic Field are now available at [emfcamp.org](https://emfcamp.org), we’ve already sent out some announcements earlier this month.

A pre-sale ticket reserves your full ticket and gives a reduction on the final ticket price. Your £30 deposit enables us to gather capital for various necessary payments required for the camp to take place. We’d really appreciate your support for ticket pre-sales if you plan to attend.

Final tickets will likely cost between £80 to £100 each, which gives you a place to pitch your tent with power and Internet, access to all events (some workshops may charge a small fee to cover costs), the bar, and the camp’s social areas from Friday 31st August to Sunday 2nd September. If you plan to arrive by car there will be an additional charge for a parking permit.

If you discover at a later date that you can’t attend the camp we’ll gladly refund £20 of your pre-sales ticket price, with £10 kept as an administrative fee. We won’t charge this fee if the final ticket price is over £100.

We’re only selling a limited number of pre-sale tickets, so if you don’t get one, don’t worry! More tickets will be available later when we begin full ticket sales.

## Other Updates

Two important announcements in case you haven’t been following our progress:

You may have seen that we’re currently setting a minimum age limit of 18 years. This is a result of the regulations and statutory requirements for such events in the UK. However after some research and a lot of discussion we are now reasonably confident that we can remove this restriction soon. We will post more updates later.

We aim to be as accessible as possible, so if you have any special requirements please [get in touch](https://wiki.emfcamp.org/wiki/Contact) and we’ll try to accommodate you. Animals will not be allowed on site, except for guide dogs.

## Want to help out?

We’re a community-run non-profit event. Want to help organise the camp? Join the mailing list, introduce yourself on IRC, participate in our weekly planning meetings. For details see the [Contact page](https://wiki.emfcamp.org/wiki/Contact), have a look at our [Teams](https://wiki.emfcamp.org/wiki/Teams) and their open positions, and the plans we have for camp volunteers.

Thanks for reading and hope to see you there!

Mark and all the rest of the EMF team
