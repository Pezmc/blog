As mentioned we’re organising a UK camping festival later this Summer: Electromagnetic Field 2012. We are now searching for contributors to give talks, workshops, and performances. We’re also inviting communities to participate by forming camp villages.

More details on ticket sales will follow soon: follow [@emfcamp](https://twitter.com/emfcamp) for updates.

# EMF 2012 CALL FOR PARTICIPATION
## About the Event
Electromagnetic Field 2012 is a three-day camping festival for people with an inquisitive mind or an interest in making things: hackers, geeks, scientists, engineers, artists, and craftspeople.

A great gathering of specialists, enthusiasts, and newcomers from many disciplines, with talks and workshops on a wide range of subjects, and many opportunities to collaborate or have a drink with someone new.

A festival for anyone interested in 3D printing, DIYBio, knitting, electronics, Internet culture, space, lockpicking, homebrewing, robots, UAVs, mind hacking, radio, or pretty much anything else you can think of.

EMF is a volunteer effort by a non-profit group, inspired by European and US hacker camps like CCC, HAR, and toorcamp.

## Talks

A 1h presentation about a topic in science, engineering, DIY, technology, arts, or crafts. The allocated time includes Q&A, setup, and teardown. 

## Workshops

A 1h, 2h, or 3h workshop involving practices in science, engineering, DIY, technology, arts, or crafts. The allocated time includes setup and teardown. 

We hope to have enough desk space and chairs for everyone, but details are yet to be determined. If you prefer to hold open-ended workshops then we encourage you to start or join a village: see below for details.

## Performances

Musical performances, DJ sets, artistic performances, general evening entertainment, …  

We will provide a stage area in a tent and a basic PA.

## Villages

Villages are dedicated camping areas for particular groups, with shared access to power and Internet. You can form a village for your local hackerspace, art form, project, or any other community. This makes it easier for people to get to know each other and encourages collaboration while at the festival, be it for cooking sessions or to build ambitious installations. 

Villages are not planned through our submissions system. Instead you can register your village [here](https://wiki.emfcamp.org/wiki/Villages)

## Venue Details

EMF 2012 is a camping festival in a field. The venue is Pineham Park, near Milton Keynes in the UK.
We plan to have two event tents with an audience capacity of about 100 each, both with access to power and Internet, each with a projector, and at least one of the tents will have a PA for larger presentations. We also aim to have camp-wide wifi, and ethernet ports in key locations.

We will attempt to stream the talks and performances and publish the recordings after the event.

## Budget and Travel expenses

The EMF camp is a non-profit event produced entirely by volunteers, and speakers are not paid. Unfortunately we can not subsidise your entry ticket, and we do not have a travel budget for contributors either; due to the nature of the event we expect that everyone pays. We may be able to make a few very rare exceptions, but don’t count on it.

## Dates and Deadlines

We’re keeping submissions open right up to the event. Notification of acceptance will be sent by e-mail as early as possible.

Electromagnetic Field 2012 is held between Friday 31 August and Sunday 2 September 2012.
