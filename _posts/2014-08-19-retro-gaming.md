Awesome Retro are a non-profit organisation based in the Netherlands dedicated to bringing the joy of gaming to events around Europe. They’re bringing their fantastic selection of consoles, along with some fabulous decorations (if you’ve seen any photos of last year, you can’t help but notice the giant pacman).

Retro Games Party is the conglomeration of two classic arcade collectors into one unbelievable arcade based in Bolton. They’re actually having their grand opening the same weekend as EMF so can’t represent in person, however they are lending us as many arcade machines as we can fit into the back of a van.

Have a look at both Awesome and Retro’s collections and let us know on twitter if there’s anything specific you’d like to see!
