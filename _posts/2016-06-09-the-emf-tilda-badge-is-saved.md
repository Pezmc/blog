Last month [we told you](http://blog.emfcamp.org/post/144514906298/tilda-mk%CF%80-the-hackable-conference-badge-that) that TiLDA, our hackable Python-powered WiFi-enabled conference badge, was on the verge of being cancelled due to lack of funding.

Thanks to some very generous last-minute sponsorship, we can confirm that the designs have been sent to production, and each attendee of Electromagnetic Field 2016 will receive their own badge for free!

We’re also extremely pleased to announce that the badges will be entirely manufactured in the UK.

We’d especially like to thank:

* [HCD](http://www.hcduk.com/) for sponsoring assembly of the badges in their Hertfordshire factory.
* [Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com), [Nexmo](https://www.nexmo.com), and Get Smarter Energy for providing substantial last-minute funding.
* [Wurth Elektronik](https://www.we-online.com/web/en/wuerth_elektronik/start.php) for sponsoring passive components.

We also want to thank [Texas Instruments](https://ti.com) and [STMicroelectronics](https://st.com) again for their huge help in sponsoring the chips to make this project a reality.

The photo above is still a prototype, and the final design of the badges will only be revealed at the event, but here’s a sneak peek:

Tickets for EMF 2016 are now sold out, so if you haven’t got one yet, the only way to get your hands on a badge is to [submit a talk or workshop](https://www.emfcamp.org/cfp) to our Call for Participation. An accepted proposal guarantees you the chance to buy one of the very few remaining tickets.
