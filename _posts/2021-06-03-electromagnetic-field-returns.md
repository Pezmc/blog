title: "Electromagnetic Field Returns: 2nd-5th June 2022"
---
We are excited to announce that one year from today we'll be back in the field!

Electromagnetic Field will return to [**Eastnor Castle Deer Park**](https://eastnorcastle.com/eastnor-deer-park/) from **Thursday 2nd - Sunday 5th June 2022**.

The EMF site will open to all attendees on Thursday 2nd June, with the full programme of events kicking off the next morning on Friday 3rd June. Both Thursday and Friday are UK bank holidays.

**Tickets will go on sale later this year.** If you bought tickets to EMF 2020, you are guaranteed the opportunity to buy tickets to EMF 2022. We will be in touch with details closer to the ticket sale.

We've had to move the date of EMF for 2022. While we would love to continue running EMF during the school summer holidays, unfortunately Eastnor also hosts two large music festivals every year and both events plan to increase in size - leaving us without enough time to organise EMF in between them.

Eastnor is an ideal site for EMF, so we chose to move our dates rather than start a painstaking hunt for suitable venues with availability during the busiest period in the festival season. 

For those who want even more camping: We've worked closely with our friends organising the re-scheduled [MCH2021](https://mch2021.org) event in the Netherlands to [ensure our dates do not clash](https://mch2021.org/#/Blog/the-stars-align-the-path-to-mch2022-is-clear), so next year you can attend both!

If you'd like to keep up to date with EMF announcements as the event approaches, join our [mailing list](https://www.emfcamp.org) and follow our [twitter account](https://twitter.com/emfcamp).

We can't wait to see you all again.

Love,
The EMF Team
