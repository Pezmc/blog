title: "Electromagnetic Field 2020: Ticket Sales"

---
As you're hopefully aware, [Electromagnetic Field is returning](https://www.emfcamp.org) to Eastnor Castle Deer Park in Herefordshire at the end of July 2020. As we continue to grow, we have to make some changes to the way we sell tickets in order to keep the event sustainable for the countless volunteers who make the event happen.

## Capacity

Firstly, we've made the decision to increase the capacity of EMF 2020 to 2750 people -- a 10% increase, which is the smallest since we started EMF in 2012. We're doing this so we don't over-stretch our organising team, and so we can continue making EMF better, rather than just bigger.

This unfortunately means that -- as those who tried to get tickets to EMF 2018 can attest -- demand for tickets will almost cetainly outstrip supply.

## Volunteer Tickets

The main change we're making this year is ensure that those who volunteer, or otherwise help to make EMF an amazing event, don't have to scramble to get a ticket. EMF simply would not happen without this amazing group of people.

The first round of ticket sales will be for these volunteers only. Over the next few weeks we'll be sending out vouchers to those who volunteered, spoke, or otherwise contributed at EMF 2018. These vouchers will guarantee you the chance to buy two adult tickets (as well as child tickets) until February 1st, 2020.

## Call for Participation

As always, if you submit a talk or workshop to our Call for Participation for this year and your submission is accepted, you will be guaranteed the chance to buy a ticket.

The CfP will also open shortly and we expect to start the first round of review in February.

## Public Ticket Sales

The remainder of the tickets to EMF 2020 will go on sale in at least three batches after February 1st, 2020. We'll announce the dates and times of these public ticket sales closer to the time.

## Ticket Prices

Unlike in previous years, we will not be offering lower "early bird" prices in earlier rounds of ticket sales. In the past, "early bird" pricing was useful to encourage people to buy tickets earlier and provide the money we needed to put down deposits for suppliers. 

However, due to increased demand and EMF's improved financial stability, we no longer need to provide this incentive, which mostly benefitted those who had money available to spend before Christmas.

It's possible that we may need to alter ticket prices slightly for later ticket sales as our budget evolves, but otherwise these prices will remain the same throughout all ticket sales:

* Adult ticket: **£140**
* Under-18 ticket: **£55**
* Under-12 ticket: **Free**
* Parking ticket: **£18**
* Camper van/caravan ticket: **£45**

As always, we will provide the option of paying more for a supporter ticket, which will provide money for us to subsidise tickets for those who otherwise could not afford to attend.
