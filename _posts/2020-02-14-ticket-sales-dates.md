As you probably already know, Electromagnetic Field will be returning to the lovely Eastnor Castle Deer Park in Herefordshire on July 23-26 this year.

## Tickets

Tickets for EMF 2020 will be put on sale at the following times:

* Wednesday 19 February at 19:00 GMT
* Saturday 14 March at 11:00 GMT
* Thursday 2 April at 21:00 BST (UTC+1)

As always, tickets are only available at [emfcamp.org/tickets](https://www.emfcamp.org/tickets), and you can see the ticket options and prices there now.

We expect each batch of tickets to sell out quickly, so you may want to set a reminder!

## Call for Participation

Our Call for Participation is also now open. If you want to talk, perform, or run a workshop at EMF, you can now [submit your proposal](https://www.emfcamp.org/cfp).

If your proposal is accepted, you'll be guaranteed two adult tickets (along with any child tickets).

The CfP will be open until June 18th, but the earlier you submit, the greater your chance of being accepted.
