Electromagnetic Field will be returning to Eastnor Castle Deer Park in Herefordshire on 2nd-5th June this year!

Ticket Sale Dates
-----------------
Tickets for EMF 2022 will be put on sale at the following times:

* Thursday 24th February at 19:00 GMT
* Saturday 5th March at 11:00 GMT
* Monday 14th March at 21:00 GMT

As always, tickets are only available at [emfcamp.org/tickets](https://emfcamp.org/tickets), and you can see the ticket options and prices there now.

We expect each batch of tickets to sell out very quickly, so set a reminder!

Call for Participation
----------------------

Our Call for Participation is also now open. If you want to talk, perform, or run a workshop at EMF, you can now [submit your proposal](https://emfcamp.org/cfp).

**If your proposal is accepted you’ll be guaranteed the opportunity to buy two adult tickets**, and any child tickets you need.

**We're also looking for exciting installations** for attendees to interact with around the site, and in Null Sector. You can find more information about building installations on our [installation support pages](https://www.emfcamp.org/cfp/installation).

**The CfP will be open until May 15th**, but the earlier you submit, the greater chance of being accepted!
